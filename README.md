Dive into _Hook-a-Fish!_, a game inspired by childhood memories, where you face a fun, fast-paced fishing challenge against the clock.

The goal is simple: catch as many fish as you can. Each fish you catch gives you extra time, and you can share your results with friends to challenge them.

# Install dependencies (only the first time)
npm install

# Run the local server at localhost:5173 and localhost:2567 for client and server respectively
npm run dev

# Build for production in the client/dist and server/dist directories
npm run build
```
